Row Id Generation:
    Introduction
        The Table Id consists on a unique Row Id for each table that is generated by the Python Code and it has the following Structure X-XXXXXXXXXX where:
            - The first part of the structure "X-" represents the prefix utilized by the Id
            - The second part of the structure "-XXXXXXXXXX" represents de suffix of the Id

        Every time that a new Id is generated, it adds a value to the suffix and when the maximum value for the suffix is reached, it returns the suffix to zero (0000000000) while adding the next value in the prefix, keeping sure the Id is always unique and it has the maximum number of different Ids with the smaller number of characters possible.

        The id consists on a 14 alphanumeric characters (0 to 9...A to Z) where 11 of those characters are modifiable and 1 is fixed. As I mentioned before the structure follow the idea of:
            - Prefix + dash + Suffix = X-XXXXXXXXXX

    The logic behind it
        Having in mind that it uses an alphanumeric logic, it uses the following logic:
        It starts with the id: 0-000000000000
        Increments by 1 generating the next id of: 0-0000000001
        When it reach the number 9 and generate the next id, instead of the next id being 10, it change to the characters (in this case, staring with A, going to Z). Example:
            - 0-0000000000001
            - ...
            - 0-0000000000009
            - 0-000000000000A
            - 0-000000000000B
            - ...
            - 0-000000000000Z
        When the "counter" is equal 35 (it starts with 0), it returns the counter to 0 and change 1 character before the current character that is Z. Example:
            - 0-000000000Z (counter = 35). When I generate the next id, instead of the counter add 1, it is updated to 0 and add 1 to the previous character, returning the value:
            - 0-0000000000010
        Then, it follows the same logic:
            - 0-0000000000011
            - 0-0000000000012
            - ...
            - 0-0000000000019
            - 0-000000000001A
            - 0-000000000001B
            - ...
            - 0-000000000001Z
            - 0-0000000000020
            - ...
            - 0-000000000002Z
    Why?
        On doing this, the idea is to have an unique id for all tables. Every table (old and/or newer) can use the same structure and have unique ids, discarding the need to creating and managing different "sequences" in different tables.
    The Math
        The math of how many id's can be generated can be calculated using the following math:
        Total of alphanumeric values which is: 10 numbers + 26 letters = 36
        Total of modifiable columns: 14 (the dash is fixed)
    The Equation
        36 ^ 14 = 6.140.942.214.464.815.497.216 (Total number of possible different ids)
        A readable version is: 6 sextillion, 140 quintillion, 942 quadrillion, 214 trillion, 464 billion, 815 million, 497 thousand, 216

    NOTE:
        If by any chance the this number get reached, you can just change the "limiter" in the code, allowing it to create more Ids.
        If it reach the maximum of 50 characters, it will require to ALTER the table ROW_ID in the database.
